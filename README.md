# Info about ScummVM
ScummVM is a program which allows you to run certain classic graphical point-and-click adventure games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed!

ScummVM supports many adventure games, including LucasArts SCUMM games (such as Monkey Island 1-3, Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max, ...), Sierra's AGI games (such as King's Quest 1-3, Space Quest 1-2, ...), Discworld 1 and 2, Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, Beneath A Steel Sky, Lure of the Temptress, Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the Amazon Queen, Gobliiins 1-3, The Legend of Kyrandia 1-3, many of Humongous Entertainment's children's SCUMM games (including Freddi Fish and Putt Putt games) and many more.

# Info about the wrapper
The ScummVM Wrapper is a modified version of the ScummVM application, meant to give a more Mac-like feel to the games, providing an application icon to doubleclick in order to run the game, without having the end user mess with loading game data folders inside the ScummVM user interface.
